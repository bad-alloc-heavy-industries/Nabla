# Nabla

Nabla is a from-scratch high quality programmers hex editor designed to make viewing very large files of data and interacting with them both easy and intuative.
The project also aims to provide good support for showing the differences between two files in a manner similar to dhex.

One of the central goals of the project is to provide support for both light and dark themes and being able to customise the colours used in the (optional) classification of bytes.
The aim being to provide the highest quality interface possible to view data in and with support for viewing the data as unicode encodings as well as traditional 8-bit encodings when using a hex+text view.
